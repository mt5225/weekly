#流失帐
##www.uinnova.com go live
- [www.uinnova.com](http://www.uinnova.com) go live in Sunday. A record is now pointing to the new website, while still be extensive review, we decide to hold @ record unchanged.
 
## Public Gallery Widget
- Aohan argue that we should keep an '**public**' gallery so new user could explore the capability of uDCB, or even create their own datacenter base on samples in pulbic gallery. so I create in new widget for that purpose. now there are two widget sections in nodebb:  [1] private gallery, which is private to the owner, and [2] public gallery, which can be seen, explored and even modified by all registered users. note that if one have modify *scene* from public gallery, and click **save** button, scene is saved as private gallery while the public one stay unchanged. 


## Sanity Check 
- It is an ongoing task, every new uDCB online, uDCB standalone, and uDCV version come out, i need to test the product individually as well as the end to end process.


## Side Project : [taverna](http://www.taverna.org.uk/ )
- I notice the workflow engine as it become incubator Apache project, lightweight and have an academic, taverna could be candidate of an generic automation engine.
