## Version Strategy
- due to *urgent* [**every request is urgent, but some request is more urgent than others**] need of English version, i suggest to maintain Engish version in an separate svn repository, as well as tracing bugs and RFEs individually. 
- create tasks according to above thoughts in tower and assigned to 田野.
