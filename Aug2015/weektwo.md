 Focus on three things this week:
 
 1. English website [dcv_en_website](http://54.186.219.119:8080/), editing a website could become an time-consuming tasks really quick even you get an existing en website exists. i need to cooperate with people from existing websites, content planning and editing, re-collect images, videos, etc. To make pace, Donny and I decided to have conference call 11:30 am everyday started from Thursday .
 2. apply social account along twitter/linkedin/facebook using an dedicated corporate email box social@uinnova.com. unfortunately the twitter account is taken and no one have the password for that account. i will follow up this issue next week.
 3. since uDCB is merged into mmd and they have make an **NEW** version of uDCB, the existing "online datacenter creation" use case is **not compatible** with this **NEW** version, meanwhile the **OLD** is not compatible with the new version of DCV english version. it breaks the workflow an little bit. i have start the process of redo the e2e process based on new website, will finish next week.
 4. also evolves in on testing our much expecting and participated product **ITA** an little, can not wait to see her go live.
