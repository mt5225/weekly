 Focus on three things this week:
 
 1. English website [dcv_en_website](http://54.186.219.119:8080/), editing a website could become an time-consuming tasks really quick even you get an existing en website exists. i need to cooperate with people from existing websites, content planning and editing, re-collect images, videos, etc. To make pace, Donny and I decided to have conference call 11:30 am everyday started from Thursday .
 2. apply social account along twitter/linkedin/facebook using an dedicated corporate email box social@uinnova.com. unfortunately the twitter account is taken and no one have the password for that account. i will follow up this issue next week.
 3. since uDCB is merged into mmd and they have make an **NEW** version of uDCB, the existing "online datacenter creation" use case is **not compatible** with this **NEW** version, meanwhile the **OLD** is not compatible with the new version of DCV english version. it breaks the workflow an little bit. i have start the process of redo the e2e process based on new website, will finish next week. No redo every single function, such as user registering, repository, etc in this phase, just be able to draw and export the data file.
 4. also evolves in on testing our much expecting and participated product **ITA** an little, can not wait to see her go live.
